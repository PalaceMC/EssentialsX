# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE THROUGH THE SERVER CONFIGS!!!
# All edits must be made on the original source file at
# https://github.com/almic/EssentialsX/

# We do it this way so whenever we make changes to the plugin,
# there's no need to reconfigure the files and update them.
# When updating this plugin, even for something as small as
# changing a single item here, you MUST push a commit to the
# repository, delete the configs on each server using Essentials,
# and reinstall the new jar files and let them regenerate the
# configs. It's much easier to track changes that way.

# I'm dead serious... do it this way please.
